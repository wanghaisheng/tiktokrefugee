### Historical Events Leading to the Rise of TikTok Refugees

#### The Russia-Ukraine War and TikTok's Role

The Russia-Ukraine war, often referred to as the "first TikTok war," played a significant role in the emergence of TikTok as a platform for refugees. Ukrainian refugees utilized TikTok to live stream events and share their experiences, connecting with global audiences in real-time. This use of TikTok as a tool for storytelling and political contestation during the conflict highlighted its potential as a platform for refugees to voice their stories and experiences [Sage Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/20563051241279248).

-   **Refugee Storytelling**: The war provided a backdrop for refugees to use TikTok to document their lives, share the raw realities of conflict, and engage with a global audience, thus increasing the platform's relevance to refugee communities [Sage Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20563051241279248).

#### The History of TikTok Bans

The rise of TikTok refugees is also closely tied to the history of TikTok bans, particularly in the United States. The timeline of these events has directly influenced the migration of users to alternative platforms.

-   **2020-2021**: The Trump administration attempted to ban TikTok in the US over national security concerns related to its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. These efforts were met with legal challenges and were eventually paused by federal courts [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-timeline-ban-biden-india-d3219a32de913f8083612e71ecf1f428).

-   **2023-2024**: The UK government and the BBC announced bans on TikTok on government and employee devices, respectively, citing security concerns. In the US, several states banned TikTok on government devices, further escalating tensions [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_TikTok).

-   **2024**: A federal appeals court upheld a ban on TikTok in the US, leading ByteDance to appeal to the Supreme Court. This series of events culminated in a looming deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a ban, set for January 19, 2025 [Tom's Guide](https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/vpns/the-us-tiktok-ban-a-full-timeline).

#### US-China Tech Tensions

The broader context of US-China tech tensions has also contributed to the rise of TikTok refugees. These tensions have led to increased scrutiny and restrictions on Chinese technology companies, including TikTok.

-   **Science and Technology Pact**: The rising tensions between the US and China have threatened to sever a long-standing science and technology cooperation pact, highlighting the broader geopolitical context affecting tech companies like TikTok [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/68ab4ed3-2f9a-4d0d-a23e-59db2555e1b0).

-   **Chip War**: The US-China chip war has escalated, with the US imposing restrictions on technology exports to China, further straining relations and impacting companies like ByteDance [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/07/12/1076156/us-china-tech-war-escalating/).

-   **Micron Technology Review**: China's security review of US memory-chip giant Micron Technology and potential restrictions on rare earth metal exports are indicative of the retaliatory measures in the tech conflict [Investors.com](https://www.investors.com/news/u-s-china-trade-war-over-technology-heats-up-what-it-means-for-apple-micron-tesla/).

#### The Migration to Xiaohongshu

The culmination of these historical events led to the migration of TikTok users, referred to as "TikTok refugees," to alternative platforms like Xiaohongshu (RedNote). This migration was driven by the fear of losing access to TikTok and the desire to continue engaging with similar social media communities.

-   **January 2025**: As the deadline for the potential TikTok ban approached, many US users migrated to Xiaohongshu, leading to a surge in its popularity and downloads [Global Times](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202501/1326802.shtml).

-   **Symbolic Migration**: The move to Xiaohongshu was not only practical but also symbolic, with users expressing frustration with US lawmakers and tech giants over the potential ban [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-01-13/tiktok-refugees-flock-to-china-s-rednote-to-protest-us-bytedance-ban).

### Conclusion

The rise of TikTok refugees can be traced back to a series of historical events, including the Russia-Ukraine war, the history of TikTok bans, and the broader US-China tech tensions. These events have led to a significant migration of TikTok users to alternative platforms like Xiaohongshu, reflecting both practical and symbolic responses to the potential loss of TikTok in the US.
