### Getting Started on RedNote:

1.  **Download the App:**  Download the correct application. It is listed as both "RedNote," and "Xiaohongshu".
2.  **Create an Account:** Sign up using an email, phone number, or other social media accounts.
    *   **Phone Number Verification Issues:** Some users have reported issues with the phone number verification process. They have indicated that they are unable to get the code to verify their account (from [YouTube Comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l01N6G6hXM0&lc=UgxFTnHxLeGm1mpRwFR4AaABAg)). Some have also noted that the verification process does not seem to be working properly on their phone ([r/Tiktokhelp](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tiktokhelp)), and others have had to use an email or Google login to bypass this limitation ([YouTube Comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l01N6G6hXM0&lc=UgxFTnHxLeGm1mpRwFR4AaABAg)).
        *   **Solutions:**
            *   Use your Apple or Google account to bypass phone verification. ([YouTube Comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l01N6G6hXM0&lc=UgxFTnHxLeGm1mpRwFR4AaABAg)).
            *   If you are using a phone number, make sure to select the right country code (such as +1 for the US), as sometimes multiple +1 codes can be shown ([YouTube Comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l01N6G6hXM0&lc=Ugz5-02SnpBijyd-a2x4AaABAg)).
            *   If you have issues with the mobile app, you may be able to use the website.
3.  **Set Up Your Profile:** Customize your profile with details and your bio, so that you can be easily found.
4.  **Set Language:** You can switch to English, but it will not be comprehensive. You might have to learn a few Chinese characters.
    *  Many new users are posting videos in English, and some have indicated that they are also using translation tools or are learning Mandarin to better connect with other users ([r/Tiktokhelp](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tiktokhelp)).
5.  **Explore Content:** Browse the main content feed to find interesting content. Also explore the search option to find specific users or communities.
    * The app combines elements of both Instagram and Pinterest, as well as TikTok with a lot of visual focus, and with long-form product reviews and guides. ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F9PbCuXJq4&t=120))

*   **Algorithm:** You might need to work to train the new algorithm, to get it to suggest relevant content. Some users have also expressed concern that their previous content may not translate to the new platform.
